-------CONNECT JUPYTER TO GRID5000-------

Use of Jupter is optional when using FluidFFT MPI methods.

portA, portB, portC, and portD are ports of your choosing, such as 8888, 4000, etc.

On your workstation:

$ ssh -f login@access.grid5000.fr -L portA:localhost:portB -N
$ ssh login@access.grid5000.fr
login@access:~$ ssh -f site -L portB:localhost:portC -N
login@access:~$ ssh site


Reserve a node with oarsub:

login@site:~$ oarsub -t allow_classic_ssh -I
login@node:~$ jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=portD


In another terminal:

login@site:~$ ssh -f node -L portC:localhost:portD -N

In a browser on your workstation, go to localhost:portA.
A Jupyter Notebook page asking for a token should appear.
Enter the token given on the node by jupyter.
A Notebook page of your Grid5000 directory should now be available.

You may have to reset some SSH connections later on, particularly between your
workstation and the global access machine.
